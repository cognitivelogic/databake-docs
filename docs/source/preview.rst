Preview
=======

The preview tab lets you see an example of a small dataset of 100 rows generated from your project settings which allows you to get an idea of a sample of what your dataset might look like without commiting to generating it in full. This is very useful when checking for lost data from the application of wrappers or catching errors.

Charts
------

In addition to the table of values, a few charts are available for most columns that will display the preview data on histograms or fitted curve plots, these charts will be created from a larger set of 1000 rows in order to reduce the effect of noise on the shape of the distribution. These charts will give you a good idea as to what the shape of the distributions in your final dataset will be so that it can be adjusted reliably.
