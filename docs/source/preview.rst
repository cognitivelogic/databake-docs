Preview
=======

The preview tab lets you see an example of a small dataset of 100 rows generated from your project settings which allows you to get an idea of a sample of what your dataset might look like without committing to generating it in full. This is very useful when checking for data nullified by wrappers or catching errors.

Charts
------

In addition to the table of values, a few charts are available for most columns that will display the preview data on histograms or fitted curve plots, these charts are from a larger set of 1000 rows in order to reduce the effect of noise on the shape of the distribution. These charts will give you a good idea as to what the shape of the distributions in your final dataset will be so that it is easy to get quick feedback on your distributions so that it is adjustable.
