Export
======

Export will allow you to generate and obtain an instance of your specified dataset by running a generation task in the cloud. 

After pressing the *Export* button in the tab, you will be able to choose the number of rows you wish to generate. Selecting your desired amount and then submitting your request you will take you back to the export tab displaying a time estimate for the expected duration of the process.   

Once the job is complete you will receive a link to a zip compressed file containing a copy of your dataset stored remotely in an S3 bucket, which will be available for a week. 

Currently only comma seperated value (csv) outputs are supported but more export types are planned for the near future.
